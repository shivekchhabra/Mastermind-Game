The name of the game is "Mastermind" and I am sure most have you would have already played it as a board game.

PS- The game can be played in both single player(against CPU) as well as multiplayer mode.

In a nutshell, the game is about deducing a combination of numbers in a limited number of turns using the feedback provided based on the entered numbers.



## How to use this repository?

This code only needs numpy module. So:
